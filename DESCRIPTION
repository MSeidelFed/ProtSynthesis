Description: This package allows to grab measure isotopolg intensities from proteomics files and turn them into accurate and correct labelled peptide/protein fractions for biological interpretation.
    The package relies in the multiplexed nature of several analytical platforms to deliver optimal results but it can be used with in its bare bones if only labelled proteomics data is available.
    Proteins may have been labelled with many different stable isotopes.
